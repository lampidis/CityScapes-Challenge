# CityScapes-Challenge

## Benchmarks  

The competition comprises four benchmarks, each targeting a specific aspect of model performance:  

1. **Peak performance**  
   This benchmark serves as your baseline. It evaluates the model's segmentation accuracy on a clean, standard test set. Your goal is to achieve the highest segmentation scores here.  

2. **Robustness**  
   This benchmark tests how well your model performs under challenging conditions, such as changes in lighting, weather, or image quality. Consistency is key in this category.  

3. **Efficiency**  
   Practical applications often require compact models. This benchmark emphasizes creating smaller models that maintain acceptable performance. Itâ€™s particularly relevant for edge devices where large models are infeasible.  

4. **Out-of-distribution detection**  
   Models often encounter data that differs from the training distribution, leading to unreliable predictions. This benchmark evaluates your model's ability to detect and handle such out-of-distribution samples.
